# <span style="color: red">PRINTF() FUNCTION IN C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</span>

This is the First Team Project for the ALX Software Engineering Program.

My partner is <span style="color: green">Tony B. Nya</span>, and we builded our own version of `printf()` function in C programming language.

---

In C, `printf()` function is used to print character, string, integer, float, octal and hexadecimal values onto the standard output screen.

We can use `printf()` function with format specifier to display values:

- `%d` for integer

- `%c` for character

- `%f` for float

- `%s` for string

- `%x` for hexadecimal

- `%p` for pointer

- `%%` for % character

- `%o` for octal

- ...

To generate a newline, we can use `"\n"` in C with `printf()` statement.
